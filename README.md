# CompAlgGeo

A collection of algorithms relating to computational algebraic geometry. The repository will be updated regularly, following the progression of topics in [Cox, Little, and O'Shea's *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3). Currently, the majority of important algorithms and definitions from Chapter 2 have completed implementation.

## Usage

This project has not been packaged yet. Clone and import and the files under ```src``` to use them as modules. As the files have interdependencies, make sure to keep them in the same folder.

Please see the ```examples``` folder for sample usage patterns. The mathematical content of the examples comes from the fourth edition of the Cox-Little-O'Shea book mentioned above, and page numbered references are provided. This project claims no ownership of the examples.
